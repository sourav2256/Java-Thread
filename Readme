What are the 4 conditions for deadlock?

The four necessary conditions for a deadlock situation to occur are
1. mutual exclusion,
2. hold and wait,
3. no preemption,
4. circular set.

We can prevent a deadlock by preventing any one of these conditions.

Lock is a monitor which is used to guarantee that only 1 thread can execute at a time. // concurrency

Join is used to wait for a thread to complete, before execution continues.
